# Tracking Plan for MAJORPROJECT

## Information Gathered
- The project is an Express application that uses EJS for rendering views and Mongoose for interacting with a MongoDB database.
- The main entry point is `app.js`, which sets up routes for managing listings.
- The `models/listing.js` file defines the schema for listings, including fields for title, description, image, price, location, and country.
- The `views/listings/index.ejs` file displays all listings and provides a form to create new listings.

## Plan
- Monitor changes in the `app.js`, `models/listing.js`, and `views/listings` directory to keep track of any updates or modifications.
- Extend monitoring to include any new files created in the project.
- Ensure that any new features or changes in the application logic are reflected in the views and data model.

## Follow-up Actions
- Regularly check for updates in the project files and document any changes made to the application.
- If new features are added, ensure that the corresponding views and models are updated accordingly.
- Keep track of any new files created in the project and document their purpose and structure.
